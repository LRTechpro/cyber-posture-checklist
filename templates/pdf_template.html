<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Your score reflects how well-prepared your organization is to protect sensitive client data, continue operations during a disruption, and comply with cybersecurity best practices relevant to the mental health field.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>16–20 (Low Risk):</strong> You’re in a strong position! Your organization has practices in place to protect client information, minimize downtime, and respond to threats effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>10–15 (Moderate Risk):</strong> You’ve taken some good steps, but there are key areas—like backup validation or staff awareness—where improvement could reduce risk and improve client trust.</li>
  <li><strong>Below 10 (High Risk):</strong> Your organization is vulnerable. Addressing these gaps will help you ensure client confidentiality, regulatory compliance (HIPAA), and service continuity in times of crisis.</li>
</ul>
