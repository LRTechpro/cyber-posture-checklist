    <h1>Checklist Results</h1>
    <p>Your Score: {{ score }} out of {{ total }}</p>
    <p><strong>Cyber Risk Level:</strong> {{ level }}</p>

    <h2>What This Means for Your Organization</h2>
    <p>Your score reflects how prepared your mental health organization is to protect sensitive client data, maintain service continuity, and stay aligned with HIPAA and ethical standards.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>16–18 (Low Risk):</strong> Excellent! You’ve built strong practices around confidentiality, incident response, and operational continuity. Keep training your team and testing your systems regularly.</li>
        <li><strong>10–15 (Moderate Risk):</strong> You're on the right path, but there are gaps to address—like formalizing policies, backup validation, or staff awareness—to ensure smooth, secure care delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Below 10 (High Risk):</strong> High vulnerability. Consider addressing cybersecurity, business continuity, and HIPAA-readiness together. Improving these areas strengthens client trust and ethical resilience.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Your score reflects how well-prepared your organization is to protect sensitive client data, continue operations during a disruption, and comply with cybersecurity best practices relevant to the mental health field.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>16–20 (Low Risk):</strong> You’re in a strong position! Your organization has practices in place to protect client information, minimize downtime, and respond to threats effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>10–15 (Moderate Risk):</strong> You’ve taken some good steps, but there are key areas—like backup validation or staff awareness—where improvement could reduce risk and improve client trust.</li>
  <li><strong>Below 10 (High Risk):</strong> Your organization is vulnerable. Addressing these gaps will help you ensure client confidentiality, regulatory compliance (HIPAA), and service continuity in times of crisis.</li>
</ul>
